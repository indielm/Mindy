# Mindy

An attempt to make a Mindustry 3.5 style tower defense game in 3D.

  additional goals are
  
    use as few lines of code possible while being clearly legible.
    
    implement shaders for parallel tasks wherever it makes sense.
    
    mix in some content from mindustry 4.0 such as nicer conveyors and pipes.
    
    build on the original gamemode of towers vs endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies.
    
    networking with no desyncs.
